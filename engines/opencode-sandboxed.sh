# Ringer engine wrapper: run OpenCode under a macOS Seatbelt sandbox.
#
# OpenCode has no OS-level sandbox of its own — its --dangerously-skip-permissions
# flag (required for headless runs) disables ALL of its interactive approval
# prompts. This wrapper supplies the real containment: full network and reads,
# writes confined to the task dir, a per-run scratch/cache dir, and OpenCode's
# own state dirs.
#
# Usage (as a ringer engine bin):
#   opencode-sandboxed.sh <taskdir> [--no-sandbox] <opencode args...>
#
# The first argument is the task directory (pass "{taskdir}" first in
# args_template). "--no-sandbox" as the second argument skips Seatbelt entirely
# — wire it as the engine's full_access_args so ringer's allow_full_access gate
# still applies. macOS only (sandbox-exec); on other platforms only
# --no-sandbox mode works.

# Read-only access to paths outside the task dir is the whole point of a review
# swarm (the task dir holds only report.md; the source repo lives elsewhere), but
# OpenCode gates that behind a separate `external_directory` permission that
# --dangerously-skip-permissions does NOT cover. In a headless run each access
# still emits a permission.asked event, which any attached observer (the
# CodeIsland OpenCode plugin, for one) renders as an approval card that appears
# and vanishes milliseconds later — hundreds of times per run. Containment here
# is the Seatbelt profile below, not OpenCode's prompt: writes stay confined to
# the task dir either way. OPENCODE_PERMISSION is merged into config.permission,
# so this overrides the default without touching the user's own config.
